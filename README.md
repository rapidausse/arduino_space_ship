the goal is to have 3 leads that flash when you  push a  switch

Material : 
  Arduino UNO
  3 led
  3 electrical resistance of 220 ohms
  1 electrical resistance of 10K ohms
  1 switch
  6 electrical cable

the leds are connected to pin  3 / 4 and  5  of the arduino board 

The switch is conencted on Pin 2 .

The arduino read the pin 2 and when the value is High or Low, is write on the pin 3 / 4 / 5
